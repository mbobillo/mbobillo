Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Marion, nice to meet you !
After 15 years of work experience in Strategy and Digital Marketing, I decided to learn how to code to offer my clients a full skillset to help them digitalize their businesses and processes.
My stack is Ruby on Rails, HTMP / CSS / Javascript, and I use Webflow and Shopify as well.
I am still learning and strengthening my skills, with a lot of dedication and drive.
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m open to collaboration, both to learn from more experienced devs and to build strong tech teams when I have big projects, so don't hesitate to reach out !
